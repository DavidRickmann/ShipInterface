# ShipInterface
Command Interface for my Ship. 

This is a control interface for my boat, a dutch barge named Vagary.

It's designed to be modular and configurable. 
We will try and deplot it on other boats in due course.

The interface is written in R/Shiny.

It's designed to operate as a series of independently operating panels with a central information hub.
This project only includes the panels at the moment.

At this point they're all slightly broken because I changed the architecture of it all. I'm slowly fixing each panel.
